Missing SQL plans for everything listed in the patch_history file
Also make sure not to forget about capture chains and updating the website info page? (or remove it lol)
Also add some extra value (icon) to consumables / items which denotes their main use case (like fighting/capturing/item drops)
Also consider using strings as primary keys for some things that have to be added manually over and over (for example stuff like areaId)

Entries example:
    - User does .c funny gungeon
    - .c causes it to filter entries by entryType "clip"
    - Match the arguments to tags or clip names
    - join tables and select all rows that have all of the determined tags or name

This can be used for all searchableLists: media, clip, quote, mhl, and journal!

words:
wordType, word
(maybe don't even make a table for this?)
