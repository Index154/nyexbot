# nyexbot
A Discord bot using Javascript and SQL

A just-for-fun project based around three main commands: Encounter, fight and capture. You use these commands to find random monsters of varying rarities and to interact with them, collecting them and their item drops. I've built a plethora of other commands around these three which provide goals and additional activities to the users. Things like consumable items, a shop, special zones with unique monsters, shiny hunting, quests which make you hunt for specific monsters, crafting, daily quests, trophies, trading and much more.

I also added some unrelated commands that I came up with to this bot. These include an Elden Ring random message generator, databases for quotes, images and videos, a random nickname generator and other random stuff.

This was my first step into Javascript, Node.js, npm, SQL and more. It's actually also the first Linux server I ever set up aside from simple school projects. Because of this there is definitely a lot of room for improvement and a bunch of bad practices at play. But I try my best!
