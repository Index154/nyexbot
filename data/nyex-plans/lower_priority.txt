__**Lower priority:**__
(Same as above but even less necessary for the overall quality and completeness of the game)
- More guessing game topics
- Review of item drop rates
- Slash commands
- Equipment being scrapped when replaced
- A daily task refresh countdown in relevant commands (for example todo)

- Review of monster luck in items
- More regular realms and corresponding vortexes
- Counters for various stats
- Sorting .rec craftable by icons
- Sorting the .help command list into categories to make it easier to find something in there
- New worldbosses spawning even when there already is an active one
- Removal of type bonuses and item price fluctuations (did they even matter?)
- Renaming of "Item luck" to "Drop luck" and of "Greater Item luck" to "Rare luck"
- More random events that can occur when using enc (being moved to a realm, getting a random buff, finding currencies, losing currencies, etc.)
- Compare command code working based on equipment / item IDs instead of only working on the current drop (so it can be used in other contexts)
- Radar values being updated whenever quests are completed or monsters are obtained
- New funny mode activation method
- Bosses having actual names
- Monster modifiers (fight/capture reward variety)
- Monster type effects (favorited monster effects)
