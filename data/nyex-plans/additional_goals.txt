__**Additional goals:**__
(These can be done at any time in any order and are not super important. Usually QoL improvements, fixes and additional features)
- A monster dex which shows how many monsters you're missing. Also has clues for how to obtain them
- A function for captures that lets you check the monsters of another user which you are missing
- Turn .inv item view into a paged embed
- Random button for captures embed
- A gather command that lets you get environmental materials based on current area (and maybe rank?) with a cooldown. Perhaps it involves sending captured monsters on expeditions too
- Descriptions for the newer equipment and monsters
- An option for captures to only show matching results as pages
- List view sorting options
- The ability to craft multiple consumables at once
- Transforming materials into others of your choosing (must be same rank, conversion rate of maybe like 5 to 1)
- Information about the areas a monster can be found in in check and caps
- List view for clip, media and such
