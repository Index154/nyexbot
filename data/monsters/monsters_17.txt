Phosphor Slime|6|13|Slime,Flying|(Special) Phosphor slimes come out at night, flying about the moonlit range upon their translucent wings. They have a luminescent slime core that pulses with a soft glow, making them easy to spot|862441145590218762/phosphor_slime.webp|4,1,1|78;
Pink Slime|7|11|Slime|(Special) Pink Slimes are cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes|862441153093435432/pink_slime.webp|3,1,1|79;
Rock Slime|15|5|Slime,Armored|(Special) Rock slimes earned their name from the rocky crown of sharp spikes atop their slimy bodies. But their affection for minerals doesn't end with their appearance: rock slimes are strict vegetarians, favoring the satisfying crunch of the heart beet most of all|862441165193347092/rock_slime.webp|1,1,1|80;
Tabby Slime|6|13|Slime,Beast|(Special) Tabby slimes share many curious similarities to domesticated house cats. With their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... if they weren't made entirely of gooey slime, of course|862441178111410176/tabby_slime.webp|2,1,1|81;

Boom Slime|38|14|Slime,Fire|(Special) Boom slimes are often heard before they're seen. The slime cells of a boom slime are constantly vibrating, causing their slime to increasingly crackle with energy before ultimately exploding. However, the boom slime always comes out unscathed, though always a little dazed|862444021666545664/boom_slime.webp|1,3,1|74;
Dervish Slime|12|39|Slime|(Special) A dervish slime is a swirling, whirling bundle of energy in slimy form. Dervish slimes are commonly found in flat regions, cruising across the ground at high speed atop little whirlwinds. One thing is for certain: wherever the dervish slime needs to go, it gets there in a hurry|862444029646995506/dervish_slime.png|2,3,1|75;
Fire Slime|31|21|Slime,Fire|(Special) Fire slimes are a rare breed of slime that lives on ash. They will eat just about any food, but not without it being burned into ash first|862444179938082816/fire_slime.webp|5,2,1|76;
Hunter Slime|23|28|Slime,Beast|(Special) The Hunter slime is the wild cousin of the tabby slime. A much more capable creature than the playful tabbies, the hunter slime excels at stalking chickens|862444156751446017/hunter_slime.webp|4,3,1|77;

Honey Slime|34|55|Slime|(Special) Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits and floral nectars|862444637586587668/honey_slime.webp|4,4,2|59;
Rad Slime|42|50|Slime|(Special) It's unknown if rad slimes, sometimes called 'raddies', came to be from external radiation sources or from something naturally occurring within their habitat. Regardless, they emit such a potent aura of radiation they glow in the dark!|862444645472796692/rad_slime.webp|5,4,2|60;
Tangle Slime|38|53|Slime,Plant|(Special) Though it may look innocent with its wide smile and colorful flower atop its head, the tangle slime is actually a fearsome predator with a big appetite for tasty meat. It earned its name from the twisting vines that it can produce to grab things in the environment|862444655694446632/tangle_slime.png|3,4,2|61;
Tarr|74|20|Slime,Dark|(Special) A sludge filled with a swirling, prismatic array of colors and a relentless appetite. The tarr seek only to consume and replicate|862444662345039892/tarr.webp|1,4,2|62;

Crystal Slime|82|41|Slime,Armored|(Special) Believed to be a cousin of the rock slime, the crystal slime is covered in a crown of shimmering, crystal spikes. These spikes seem to form from the crystal slime generating a tremendous amount of internal heat and warping the minerals around them; a truly alien behavior|862444967250362378/crystal_slime.webp|4,5,2|44;
Mosaic Slime|51|70|Slime|(Special) The mosaic slime gets its name from the glittering array of glass tiles that cover its body. This glass produces ultra-hot solar anomalies, making the mosaic slime beautiful, but quite dangerous|862444976339288064/mosaic_slime.png|5,6,2|45;
Quantum Slime|36|85|Slime,Intangible|(Special) Quantum slimes appear to have resulted from some sort of event that took place long ago. At all times, the quantum slime is capable of emitting other possible realities of their being. Called 'ghosts', these other realities can come true, with the quantum slime aligning with the reality of the ghost, effectively teleporting|862444984414371860/quantum_slime.webp|6,4,2|46;

Glitch Slime|42|112|Slime|(Special) Glitch slimes were formed from a bug in this game. Though a wholly digital entity, these slimes could easily be considered 'real' within the limits of the world they inhabit|862445208800329808/glitch_slime.webp|3,8,2|28;
Lucky Slime|54|98|Slime,Beast,Holy|(Special) Lucky slimes are a strange variant of tabby slimes that seem to have a fascination with shiny objects, particularly coins. A lucky slime gobbles up any coin it can find, giving it a distinct jingling sound as it moves about|862445217034141706/lucky_slime.webp|4,6,2|29;

Quicksilver Slime|5|187|Slime,Lightning|(Special) Quicksilver slimes are lightning quick, and feed on electricity. This is generally accomplished by their moving really fast and slowly accumulating the static charge they generate|862445392090890240/quicksilver_slime.webp|2,10,3|23;
Twinkle Slime|57|134|Slime,Legendary|(Special) Few people have ever even glimpsed a twinkle slime, with most believing it to be a legend. But those that have know it's real, and that the twinkle slime seems to be related to the passing of time, or a change in seasons. However, this is only a theory as data on twinkle slime behaviors is quite limited|862445401042845736/twinkle_slime.webp|5,8,3|24;
