Once you find one with `{prefix}encounter`, use `{prefix}capture` to capture it! You may use `{prefix}captures` at any time to see how many monsters you have. Once you have 2 Imps, use `{prefix}deliver` to complete the quest!|Nice work! Here's a consumable item for you. You may use `{prefix}inventory` to see your inventory, `{prefix}inventory [item name]` to check an item's info and `{prefix}use [item name]` to activate a consumable! Use `{prefix}quest` again to get your next task!|Starting area (Volcano);

Use `{prefix}check` on a monster you encountered or `{prefix}captures [monster name]` on one you've captured to see what it can drop!\nUnlike consumables, materials like Cloth can not be used and are found in a separate menu: `{prefix}materials`. They are also marked with this symbol upon being obtained: üõ†Ô∏è|By default you can `{prefix}use` an item only once and you can have only one buff active at a time so keep that in mind|Imp (Volcano);

captures|0,62,0|2|stat|exp&gold|150|Did you know that you can use the command `{prefix}stats` to see your current stats and other useful information?|Your Attack and Speed stats control your success chance in fights. If you focus more on one of the two then your results will vary more based on the monsters you're fighting|Underworld;
materials|195|2|item|17|2|The Item Luck stat affects the overall chance for monsters to drop items. Greater Item Luck on the other hand makes rarer drops more common without actually affecting the overall drop chance!|Another stat you can have is the Type Bonus. This stat will increase or decrease your chance of success when capturing or fighting monsters that have a type matching your Type Bonus|Chupacabra (Desert);
materials|204|3|stat|13|4|Did you know? There is a shop which changes its wares every Monday!

If you ever want to reset your stat points then you should get a Mindwipe Tonic from the shop!|Meerfolk (Ocean);
captures|0,16,0|3|stat|12|200|Your equipment is a very important aspect of your build. There are three equipment slots: Weapon, defense and the so-called divine tool. While your weapon and defensive equipment mostly alter your Attack and Speed, the tool mainly affects your Capture Efficiency which determines your chance of successfully capturing monsters|Some weapons may carry a special ability that can assist you. Defensive equipment on the other hand can only *modify* your weapon's ability. Lastly, your tool decides how the ability activates. This can be either time-based, after a certain amount of encounters or by chance!|Ocean;
materials|202|3|item|42|1|Are you aware that you can craft items with the `{prefix}craft [item name]` command? It's very useful for upgrading your equipment! You can also view a list of recipes with `{prefix}recipes` or only recipes for items you are able to craft with `{prefix}recipes craftable`!|In the future you may need a resource called Scrap.

inventory|40|2|item|231|1|Did you know? The shop always sells an item known as Dimensional Fragment. You can use this item to travel to hidden areas called realms. Inside of a realm you will have a limited amount of HP that drops whenever you use capture or fight. Your starting HP depends on your level and rank. The main advantage of realms is that losing a fight inside of one will not end the encounter. This means that you can keep fighting a monster repeatedly until you win! Another reason to visit realms is that you can obtain special drops there|Every regular realm has its own corresponding Vortex drops and there are three different rarities per Vortex type. You can think of Vortexes kind of like free loot boxes that give you items related to their origin|Hellcat & Hellhound (Volcano);

inventory|37|3|item|105|1|Take a look at the `{prefix}completion` command! It shows you how much of the game you've completed! The higher your completion percentages are, the more effective your `{prefix}radar` command will be! What is the radar? Activating the radar will grant you a buff that lasts longer the more radar charges you have. This buff increases your chance of encountering shiny monsters! But be warned that the radar is only useable above level 5!|After you've reached level 15 you can use the command `{prefix}fullradar` to focus all of your radar charges into a single encounter in exchange for some Gold!
