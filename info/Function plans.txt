Unspecified
- Shorten the code needed in commands for using levelCheck / Improve the function?
- Instead of having some values saved in files or tables, maybe it could be better to define them directly inside a function's code (if the only code that requires that data is the function itself) - example: convertToIcon => Check this while or after reworking the code (adding SQL and functions)
- IMPORTANT: Always think about trophies and what sort of functions to build in order for the trophy check placements to work out the best
- Function for sending a message (will take the content you wanna send and automatically chooses the correct discordjs function - Also make this determine whether the message should contain the "@username" text)
- How to deal with things being removed or added multiple times from the same "lists" in one command? Do I need to worry or not once everything is SQL?
- How to stop a higher level async function? Do I need to use an extra if-statement based on the return value? (I sort of forgot what I even meant by this question)
- Put the dead ends (returns) of the code into the lower levels (nesting) and keep the main path close to the top to reduce nesting
- Add additional comments that actually explain stuff that is unintuitive (like unique calculations)
- Change where and how which functions are imported and from which module to improve performance?

App
- Worldboss spawning logic (happens in both message and interaction events)
- DM a user (happens in app (worldboss spawn event and update event) and worldboss)
- Alert announcement channels (happens in app (worldboss spawn event and update event) and worldboss)
- Try to execute commands (happens in app in both message and interaction events)
- Check for custom server prefix (happens in all commands)

Library
- Paged embed functions (combine their common points into one somehow?)
- Check if existing functions can be added to more commands
- Add {prefix} replacing to readFile?
- Automatically add "@ __**username**__" to command outputs if the command was triggered using a button
- Make functions for the individual embeds that are created for paged embeds
- Make splitList function for turning strings into arrays easily, like this:
    function splitList(list, separator){
            if(list.includes(separator)){
                list = list.split(separator);
            }else if(list !== ""){
                list = [list];
            }else{
                list = [];
            }
            return list;
    }
- Make a function for interpreting user args 

Add
- Only let me use the command (also happens in doadmin)

Area
- Set username and dir variables (happens in almost all commands) (?)

Buy
- onlyUnique (happens in several commands - Just move it to the library lol)
- Disallow unregistered users (happens in most commands)
- Weekly event realm update and check if user should be moved (happens in some commands)
- Generate new shop if necessary or load existing shop (also happens in shop and sell)
- Merchant ability check (also happens in sell?)
- Check if the user has enough of something (items, monsters or currency) (happens in several commands)
- Remove things from the user (items, monsters, currency) (happens in several commands) (always also trigger the "check if user has enough" function inside of this one)
- Give item(s) to the user (also include the equip prompt event with buttons in this) (happens in many commands)
- Add a monster to the captures and possibly the dex (happens in several commands)
- Build a list of names + match user input to the list to find one or more result(s) (happens in several commands - maybe just wait for SQL for this one since it will be way more simple then)
- Generate a random monster (happens in several commands - for stuff like encounter it should consider the user's stats and area but there also need to be special cases where it follows different rules, like in this command)

Capture
- Load monster info (happens in several commands? - wait for SQL?)
- Activate abilities if possible (also happens in fight and enc)
- Reduce realm HP (also happens in fight)
- Grant a trophy (happens in several commands - will later hopefully mostly be used inside of other functions!)
- Grant a trophy based on captured monsters (combine with "monster obtaining" function)
- End an encounter (also happens in fight - influenced by realms and abilities)

Captures
- Match input to another user (name or ID and then a random one from the results) (happens in the function below)
- Execute a command in the name of another user to check their stuff (happens in several commands)
- Build a monster info embed (also happens in check and possibly more commands)

Check
/

Class
- Keep users below a certain level from using the command (happens in several commands)

Clip
/

Compare
- Compare two equipment items to each other (also happens in transform)

Completion
- Check user's completion and update radar effectiveness (also happens in radar and fullradar - perhaps it should instead happen at the start of every encounter or something similar - currently in encounter it only reads the latest values instead of updating them)

Countdown
/

Craft
/

Daily
- Load a quest (also happens in quest)
- Generate a new random quest (also happens in dodaily)

Deliver
- Complete a quest (also happens in dodaily)
- Give currencies or exp to the user (also happens in several other commands - important for trophies and abilities (for example merchant))
- Grant a trophy based on user level (combine this with levelCheck somehow)

Encounter
- Register a user (also happens in monster - maybe add this to all commands later? - in that case make it not start an encounter every time...)
- Randomly pick an outcome from a list of possibilities, each with their own chances of happening (happens in many commands and in different forms - here it is used for possibly generating a random event like finding treasure - maybe use switch cases for processing the results of this function?)
- Grant a buff to the user, possibly overwriting the current buff (happens in several commands - make the buff random if no values are supplied?)
- Reduce the duration of the active buff and possibly end its effect (happens in some commands)
- Take the user to a different area (also happens in move and use - in the case of this and use it is realms specifically but it can maybe be combined)
- Start an encounter + roll for shininess (separate this or not?) (happens in a few commands. Make sure to consider Reality Shifters for this too)
- Display a monster / encounter (happens in all commands that start encounters but also happens in different ways in showencounter and monster)

Equip
- Equip an item (also happens in transform and maybe more!)
- Convert equipment or materials into Scrap (also happens in materials - should also happen automatically when an old equipment is replaced)

Fate
/

Fight
- Bet Gold on succeeding (should maybe also happen in capture?)
- Determine an item to receive from a pool of possible items (also happens in slightly different forms in use (vortex) and other commands - in fight it is sepcial due to being influenced by luck - maybe also do this in other commands?)
- Reduce the user's HP in a realm and possibly move them out (also happens in capture)

Fullradar
- Claim daily radar charges (also happens in radar)

Use
- Use one or more items (yes this should be a function cause I might want other commands to trigger item uses too later on)
- Unpack one or more vortexes (don't know if this really needs to be an extra function. To think about later...)

Worldboss
- Get a random element from an array (in this case it's for the boss modifier - Also happens in many other commands - Maybe I already wrote this down?)
