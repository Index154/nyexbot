__**Additional goals:**__
(These can be done at any time in any order and are not super important. Usually QoL improvements, fixes and additional features)
- Make .help a paged embed so it doesn't take away too much space
- A daily task refresh countdown in relevant commands (Example: A timer to show when the next daily will be, visible in daily and todo)
- More random events that can occur when using enc (being moved to a realm, getting a random buff, finding currencies, losing currencies, etc.)
- Removal of type bonuses and item price fluctuations (did they even matter?)
- An option (or permanent change) for captures to only show matching results (Example: `.caps slime` => Then you can browse through all the Slime results with the buttons) | Similar to how media, clip and such work currently
- New funny mode activation method
- Renaming of the luck stats to better represent their uses
- Descriptions for the newer equipment and monsters
- The ability to craft multiple consumables at once
- Transforming materials into others of your choosing (must be same rank, conversion rate of maybe like 5 to 1)
- Information about the areas a monster can be found in in check and caps
- A function for captures that lets you check the monsters of another user which you are missing
- List views for clip, media and such
- List view sorting options (easier to implement with SQL)
- A monster dex which shows how many monsters you're missing. Also has clues for how to obtain them (requires SQL)
