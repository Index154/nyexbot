__**Additional goals:**__
(These can be done at any time in any order and are not super important. Usually QoL improvements, fixes and additional features)
- A button for starting a new research right after finishing one
- Crafting system rework: No more equipment upgrades or set recipes for equipment. Instead every material has certain attributes (but no specific numbers) and you can craft custom equipment using a certain number of them (3 to 5?). The attributes of the ingredients then determine the resulting equipment item's stats and so on. The rank and values of the stats will be determined based on the average rank of the ingredients and how often each attribute is present. Example: Using 4 D-Rank materials with only attack attributes will make an equipment with 10 Attack (plus some random fluctuation). If one of them had speed instead of attack then it would maybe have 8 attack and 2 speed on average
- The ability to browse the details of items in the shop (like inventory embeds)
- Convert media and quote into SQL commands with tags, then make `add` also use SQL
- Make .help a paged embed so it doesn't take away too much space
- A daily and weekly refresh countdown in relevant commands (Example: A timer to show when the next daily will be, visible in daily and todo. Or a countdown to the next shop reset in the shop footer)
- More random events that can occur when using enc (being moved to a realm, getting a random buff, finding currencies, losing currencies, etc.)
- An option (or permanent change) for captures to only show matching results (Example: `.caps slime` => Then you can browse through all the Slime results with the buttons) | Similar to how media, clip and such work currently
- New funny mode activation method
- Renaming of the luck stats to better represent their uses
- Descriptions for the newer equipment and monsters
- The ability to craft multiple consumables at once
- A special (shop) item that lets you save a shiny chain for later
- Transforming materials into others of your choosing (must be same rank, conversion rate of maybe like 5 to 1)
- Information about the areas a monster can be found in in check and caps
- A function for captures that lets you check the monsters of another user which you are missing
- List views for clip, media and such
- List view sorting options (easier to implement with SQL)
- A monster dex which shows how many monsters you're missing. Also with clues (area icons) for obtaining them (requires SQL)
