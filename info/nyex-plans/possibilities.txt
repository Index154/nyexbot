__**Possibilities:**__
(Might not ever be implemented - Rough ideas)
- Removal of consumable crafting (recipes in general)?
- A new player stat called Chaos: Affects many events in the game, making them "more random" the higher the stat is?
- Material research projects that grant random materials of the player's rank?
- Being able to preview the loot tables of vortexes?
- The ability to bet Gold on a fight with possible rewards corresponding to the winning chance?
- Check being tied to the active encounter again?
- Equipment being put into the equipping queue when replaced so you can switch back?
- Seasonal events / anniversary?
- Some sort of difficulty increase after unlocking the level cap?
- NG+ mechanics? Maybe let the player reset their level back to 1 and pick an additional class after reaching level 10 again?
- Public availability of the bot?
- A command to reset your account? (Except for trophies? Maybe combine this with the NG+ idea?)
- Let users update reminders?
- Allow users to define their timezone for reminders?
- Get a role when joining vc and lose it when leaving (for vc-text access)
