## __Main goals__
`These are essentially the most important goals for making the game somewhat complete. However, they are less likely to happen quickly because they require more effort`
- More quests (Next: C)
- More unique realms (= new exclusive monsters)
- SQL database implementation + full code rewrite including centralization of common operations as functions, removal of underscores from file / variable names, changing where all the data is saved and de-nesting by making the nested code be the error paths
- Security considerations: Sanitize user inputs
- Replace old images for unimplemented MH monsters
- Redesign the quests to be less difficult at the start
- More buttons working with single message mode
- **Random encounter events (like finding treasure) being presented as a ? button you have to press which then triggers a random event from a list of possibilities**
