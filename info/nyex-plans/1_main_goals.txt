__**Main goals:**__
(Basically these are the most important goals for making the game somewhat complete. However, they are less likely to happen quickly because they require more effort)
- More quests (Next: C)
- Integration of knowledgebase info into the help command
- More unique realms (= new exclusive monsters)
- SQL database implementation (also includes monster dex numbering and more trophies) + full code rewrite including centralization of common operations as functions and de-nesting by making the nested code be the error paths
- Make all commands create a user account? Or at least wb
- Security considerations: Sanitize user inputs
- Integrate deliver and dodaily into quest and daily as subcommands
