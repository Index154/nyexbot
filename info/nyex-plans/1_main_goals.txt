__**Main goals:**__
(Basically these are the most important goals for making the game somewhat complete. However, they are less likely to happen quickly because they require more effort)
- Unique images for all shinies
- More quests (Next: C)
- More unique realms (= new exclusive monsters)
- SQL database implementation (also includes monster dex numbering and more trophies) + full code rewrite including centralization of common operations as functions
