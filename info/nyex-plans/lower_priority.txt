__**Lower priority:**__
(Same as above but even less necessary for the overall quality and completeness of the game)
- The addition and improvement of some of the fun commands from Nightbot (ability, comment, decipher, actitle, mhshuffle, vietmon)
- Equipment being scrapped when replaced
- A cooldown between bosses spawning
- Bosses being able to replace each other (sort of adding a possibility of failure for the players if they take too long)
- .rec craftable being sorted by icons
- .rec showing all recipes in Discord instead of linking to the website
- Radar values being updated whenever quests are completed or monsters are obtained
- More regular realms and corresponding vortexes
- Review of monster luck in items
- Review of item drop rates
- More guessing game topics
- Slash commands
- Special hard-to-get trophies based on the seven sins (maybe wait for SQL)
- Monster type effects (favorited monster effects) (maybe wait for SQL)
- Monster modifiers (fight/capture reward variety) (maybe wait for SQL)
- Counters for various stats (requires SQL)
