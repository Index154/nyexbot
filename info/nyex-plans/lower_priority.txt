## __Lower priority__
(Same as above but even less necessary for the overall quality and completeness of the game)
- The addition and improvement of some of the fun commands from Nightbot (decipher, mhshuffle)
- .rec craftable being sorted by icons (so mostly by rank)
- .rec showing all recipes in Discord instead of linking to the website
- Radar values being updated whenever quests are completed or monsters are obtained (maybe wait for SQL)
- More regular realms and corresponding vortexes
- Review of monster luck in items
- Review of item drop rates (especially materials)
- More guessing game topics
- Special hard-to-get trophies based on the seven sins (maybe wait for SQL)
- Monster modifiers (fight/capture reward variety) (maybe wait for SQL)
- Counters for various stats (requires SQL)
- Another rework of the quest tutorials with explanations for new commands, changes and features
- Actual rewards for getting trophies (besides boss ones)
- More time increment options for reminders (weeks, months, etc.)
- Sort reminders by how soon they are
- A button on the area output which lets you check your current area
