## __Lower priority__
`Same as above but even less necessary for the overall quality and completeness of the game`
- .rec craftable being sorted by icons (so mostly by rank)
- .rec showing all recipes in Discord instead of linking to the website
- More regular realms and corresponding vortexes
- Review of monster luck in items
- Review of item drop rates (especially materials)
- Special hard-to-get trophies based on the seven sins (maybe wait for SQL)
- Counters for various stats (requires SQL)
- Another rework of the quest tutorials with explanations for new commands, changes and features
- Actual rewards for getting trophies (besides boss ones)
- Sort reminders by how soon they are
- List class abilities somewhere
- Integrate deliver and dodaily into quest and daily as subcommands (they can be used through buttons anyway)
- More guessing game topics
- The addition and improvement of some of the fun commands from Nightbot (decipher, mhshuffle)
