__v0.19.38__
- `remind` now supports weeks and months
- It also no longer requires " to " in the message
- When the bot reminds you you now have some buttons you can press to repeat that particular reminder after either 10 minutes, 1 hour or 1 day (unless the reminder is already repeating)
- Repeating reminders now come with a 'Delete' button attached to them
- The command no longer recognizes time descriptions without quantifiers (for example "daily", "week", "year". Instead use "1day", "1 week", "1y" or similar. The important part is the number)
- Reminders that are set to repeat every x months should automatically correct themselves to happen on the same date of the month every time if possible

__v0.19.37__
- `area [area name]` and `move` will now display one of several images for the chosen area

__v0.19.36__
- `nick` without arguments will now default to the "type4" option - Basically instead of `nick type4` you can now always just do `nick`

__v0.19.35__
- Fixed ".png" being attached to the name of any newly added gif, image or video
- Fixed the one image which already had this issue ("cat in street hole butt stuck poke fast.gif")

__v0.19.34__
- Removed `mhl` command since it was kinda useless and not worth maintaining
- `media`, also known as `image` now has many more images, mostly gifs, that have all been renamed to be easily searchable if you use short and concise search terms. The command now utilizes my SQL database as well so it's better
- All entries from `clip` are gone for now until I re-add them. I am currently preparing to rename and then upload all the old clips + many more new ones
- Monster images are now sourced directly from my web server instead of files uploaded to Discord. Hopefully the loading speed will be okay

__v0.19.33__
New command: `wordle` - Posts a link to the worlde page and suggests a random starting word

__v0.19.32__
- When you press a button on an encounter the bot will now edit the message the button is attached to instead of posting a new reply. I plan on implementing this for more buttons in the future
- You can revert this feature with the new toggle option `set commandmode`
- Using `set` without arguments will now post an embed with buttons for adjusting your settings
- The setting for "funny monster mode" is now also part of `set` and no longer a subcommand of `stats`
- Any command which is directly related to the game can now be used to register as a new player instead of only `encounter` and `monster`
- Changed the replies of the bot when a player uses a command for the first time
- The minigame `guess` no longer requires users to be registered to play
- `area` now also highlights your current area in the list
- Chupacabra quest now only requires one claw drop

__Oopsie__
- I had to reset the bot's directory to a clean state and I accidentally removed all the user data. Who cares, I guess. Everyone will start from level 1 again
- I also had to reset all server settings to use . as the prefix. The update channels are also no longer configured
- It's not unlikely that other issues will happen due to the reset so please do tell me if you find something

__v0.19.31__
Fixed several commands not working when you haven't set a favorite monster.
Thanks to Mr. Meow for finding the error (three times in a row) :inyup:

__v0.19.30__
- Reintroduced the old Nightbot commands `comment` and `ability`. They can be used to generate stupid random stuff

__v0.19.29__
- Updated discord.js to v14 and fixed (hopefully) all the breaking issues caused by it

__v0.19.28__
- Updated error handling

__v0.19.27__
- Fixed a couple of help pages for specific commands not being useable
- New command `tenor`: Can be used to view random gifs from tenor.com

__v0.19.26__
- Fixed yearly repeating reminders being overcorrected for leap days
- Some time displays will now properly show 365 days as a year
- The reminder list is now an embed
- The reminder list now also shows the relative time until each reminder happens (may be off by 1 minute)
- Fixed the ' character breaking reminders
- Fixed reminder text being cut off after any " to " in the message
- Fixed reminders not working in DMs
- If the channel you made the reminder in doesn't exist anymore then the bot will remind you in DMs instead

__v0.19.25__
- Prevented setting reminders for the past
- If a reminder is set to happen one or more years from now then it will now account for leap years. This means that yearly reminders should now always be on the same date
- Modified the database so that the number of reminders that can be made before there are no IDs left is now 18446744073709551615

__v0.19.24__
- New command for my personal use. Hehe
- New command: `remindme` for creating custom reminders (use `help remindme` to learn how to use it)

__v0.19.23__
- Renamed Capture Efficiency to Mana
- Renamed Item Luck to Drop Luck
- Renamed Greater Item Luck to Rare Luck

__v0.19.22__
- Removed the commands `trade` and `release` because I'm too lazy to work on them and they kinda sucked

__v0.19.21__
- Added a lot of additional details to every command's `help` page

__v0.19.20__
- Disabled reactions to bad messages because it made people act more rebelliously

__v0.19.19__
The bot will now react to certain low-effort messages with a mocking emote (currently it is using <a:jermapunch:855936170349166592> as a placeholder).
The list of messages it will react to currently includes: "lol", "uh oh", "damn", "pog", "nice", "yoo" and "sad" (case-insensitive)

__v0.19.18__
- Fixed text colors in encounter embeds after Discord changed them. Or at least I tried to fix it but sadly I couldn't find a way to make the text fully green for B-Rank monsters

__v0.19.17__
- Fixed a bunch of button interactions not working in DMs
- `help` is now separated into pages to keep the message a bit smaller

__v0.19.16__
- Added shiny images for ALL MONSTERS except 12 of them

__v0.19.15__
- Changed `fate` to require an argument and added the new argument "pokemon" to it
- New special item (sold in the shop): Memory Link. This allows you to store your current shiny chain or resume your currently stored chain. Just like the Stasis Cube each of these can be used twice before disappearing
- `inv` now also displays your saved chain
- Fixed a bug which caused your shiny chain to be lost when you try to use a Stasis Cube (rather than when you actually use it by pressing confirm)
- When you have an active capture chain then it will now be shown on every encounter embed

__v0.19.14_
- Improved the bot's security
- `scp` should no longer run into errors (ideally) and if the bot fails to find a title or description then the number of the SCP with the issue will be saved so I can check it later

__v0.19.13__
- Removed item prices changing based on how often they are bought and sold. It was a pretty meaningless feature
- Increased the use duration of many consumables to make them hopefully actually worth using every now and then
- Removed equipment crafting recipes and equipment upgrades. Planning to add a more interesting alternate use for materials later on!
- Removed type bonus values. They basically didn't matter anyway lol

__v0.19.12__
- Update and boss announcements can now be received in DMs if you sign up for it. You can enable DM announcements for yourself with `set updates` (you can disable again with the same command). The default setting is to not receive them
- Renamed errorlog command to doadmin since it can do like 7 different things that have nothing to do with error logs
- Fixed `check` showing the item drop chance as "undefined%" for shiny monsters

__v0.19.11__
- Added some additional information to the Stasis Cube and the messages you get when you use it
- Added item drop rates to `check`
- Fixed item drop rates being way too high because of a bug (why does it feel like this is not the first time)
- Increased prices / values of some special items significantly

__v0.19.10__
- Added a fullradar button to the `radar` command output (if the user fulfills the fullradar level requirement)
- Fixed `wb` breaking due to `nick` changes
- Storing an encounter in the Stasis space using a Stasis Cube now breaks your active shiny chain
- The boss spawning notification now also includes the prefix for `wb`

__v0.19.9__
- Removed type3 from nick
- You can now combine  type4 with the other types, a custom word or also with itself
Examples: nick monkey type4
nick type4 type4
nick type4 type2

__v0.19.8__
- You can now browse through your items with buttons after using inv [item name] or inv random
- I've also improved the embeds by making the spacing more consistent so all of the item details are always in the same spots

__v0.19.7__
- Added a "Random" button to the captures embed
- New command: countdown. It tracks some countdowns for cool stuff

__v0.19.6__
- Bosses now generate with a unique name (using the logic of truename from nick)

[Minor Patch]
- Greater Item Luck now operates based on average drop chance and brings the drop chances of all of a monster's drops closer to that value without changing the overall average itself 

__v0.19.5__
- nick now has a more detailed help page, explaining all the possible arguments
- The results obtained with nick can now be rerolled as often as you want with a simple button press!
- nick now also has a new argument called truename. If you use this argument then the command will generate a word that (usually) didn't exist before instead of a normal nickname

__v0.19.4__
- help has been reworked to show commands sorted by categories. It also has short descriptions for what each command does

__v0.19.3__
- New variety command: scp
Use it to get a random scp article. You can also do scp [number] to get a specific one

__v0.19.2__
- Minor fixes
- Removed the treasure feature & command (it was lame)

__v0.19.1__
- Fixed various minor things, including usernames with special characters in them breaking the formatting in most bot messages. For now the special characters are simply removed from the username. This might cause other issues later, let's find out lol

[Minor Patch]
- Added a new consumable: Glowing Bulb. It is dropped by Abyssal Eels (rank B, found in Ocean) very frequently and can be used to greatly lower your monster luck. I made this item so high rank players can still encounter lots of low rank monsters
- Fixed negative monster luck making shinies impossible to spawn in some cases 

__v0.19.0__
- Added about 130 shiny monster images, including all D-Rank shinies
- Shinies which I haven't made images for will all have the same placeholder image from now on
- Removed all shiny monster descriptions
- Increased prices for shinies in the shop

__v0.18.0__
- Added capture chains: A new shiny hunting method that allows you to hunt for specific monsters
- Simply use capture on one species of monster several times in a row to build up a chain
- The higher the chain gets, the higher the shiny chance for that particular monster will become
- The chain will only break if you try to capture any other monster (including any shiny). Fight and encounter have no effect on it
- The chain only boosts the shiny chance when you use encounter so fullradar for example will not benefit from it
- For monsters of lower ranks the chains will generally need to be longer to reach high shiny chances 

__v0.17.0__
- If you have a monster's alternate form (so shiny or non shiny) then it will appear as a thumbnail in captures when viewing the monster

[Minor Patch]
- Fixed typo in the code that caused some embeds to fail after being posted initially

__v0.16.0__
- clip now no longer considers arguments as regular expressions
- However I've added tags to each clip (examples: funny, spelunky)
- When you use the command, every argument (separated by empty spaces) will be used to match either the title or a tag of the clips. Results are only chosen if all of the arguments match something for them
- Also added a "random" button to commands like clip so you can reroll from the list of results
- clip is the first command useable by everyone to use SQL queries! 

[Minor Patch]
- Fixed some nick options having line breaks in them
- Fixed inv sometimes displaying incorrect item values

__v0.15.0__
Renamed isaac to fate (it might include other things besides isaac some day)
Also added characters, trinkets and pocket items to it as additional categories 

v0.14.0
Added command isaac which picks an item based on your user Id (your soul mate item)

v0.13.0
Worldboss is now sometimes funny (1/6 chance to make you lose Gold instead of gaining it) 

v0.12.0
Added a new fun command: http
It will post a random http status code with a cat or dog image when used

v0.11.0
From now on I will mark small and unimportant changes (such as the previous) as minor updates.
I've made it so the bot doesn't crosspost these to any other servers.
I will also make an effort of having version numbers again. 

[Minor Patch]
Fixed * without a character in front of it throwing an error in clip, media, etc. 
Fixed embeds allowing all users to press some buttons

I've imported a new command from Nightbot: pokegory (alias: pg)
- Use pg to start a prompt which will tell you a pokemon category and ask you to guess one of the pokemon in it
- Submit a guess using pg [your guess]
- A prompt will expire after three guesses (they are shared globally across all users and servers)
- For now there is no real point to using the command but I want to add rewards one day (in the same way that guess gives you scrap)
