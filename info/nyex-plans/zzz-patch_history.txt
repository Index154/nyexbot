__v0.19.13__
- Removed item prices changing based on how often they are bought and sold. It was a pretty meaningless feature
- Increased the use duration of many consumables to make them hopefully actually worth using every now and then
- Removed equipment crafting recipes and equipment upgrades. Planning to add a more interesting alternate use for materials later on!
- Removed type bonus values. They basically didn't matter anyway lol

__v0.19.12__
- Update and boss announcements can now be received in DMs if you sign up for it. You can enable DM announcements for yourself with `set updates` (you can disable again with the same command). The default setting is to not receive them
- Renamed errorlog command to doadmin since it can do like 7 different things that have nothing to do with error logs
- Fixed `check` showing the item drop chance as "undefined%" for shiny monsters

__v0.19.11__
- Added some additional information to the Stasis Cube and the messages you get when you use it
- Added item drop rates to `check`
- Fixed item drop rates being way too high because of a bug (why does it feel like this is not the first time)

__v0.19.10__
- Added a fullradar button to the `radar` command output (if the user fulfills the fullradar level requirement)
- Fixed `wb` breaking due to `nick` changes
- Storing an encounter in the Stasis space using a Stasis Cube now breaks your active shiny chain
- The boss spawning notification now also includes the prefix for `wb`

__v0.19.9__
