(
    Entries example:
    - User does .c funny gungeon
    - .c causes it to filter entries by entryType "clip"
    - Match the arguments to tags or clip names
    - join tables and select all rows that have all of the determined tags or name

    This can be used for all searchableLists: media, clip, quote, mhl, and journal!
