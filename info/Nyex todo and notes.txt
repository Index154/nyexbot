Implement !!variable to test for variable truthyness?


Markov info:

	Implemented very simply: https://medium.com/@alexkrameris/markov-chain-implementation-in-javascript-a698f371d66f
		Basically make a chain object to which you add every word as an array containing all words that ever came after it.
		Then with object.keys(chain) you can get an array of all the word arrays. Then you can pick a random starting word, pick a random word from its array and keep repeating this to get a random sequence of words.
			=> This is probably very slow and bad for large data sets
	
	More complex implementation: https://github.com/bespoyasov/text-generator
		Only works for words, not syllables?
			=> Might be worth trying
		
	The best looking version: https://github.com/vilvadot/markov-text
		Can generate single words as well as sentences
			=> Probably the best one to try and build upon


Async programming help:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous


Use JSON.parse() to transform a String into an object based on json syntax. Also use JSON.stringify(object, null, 4) to save it again.
Make sure to use asynchronous read and write functions when necessary, also define the correct encoding!


Monster modifier ideas:
    - Shimmering: Higher chance for item drops, also gives more gold and exp when defeated
    - Enchanted: Will instantly give a temporary buff when captured, may also grant radar charges


Trophy ideas:
    - Using many radar charges at once
    - Spending lotsa Gold at once
    - Ones for all the counters
    - Been to every event realm
    - Daily streak milestones


Monster type effect notes:
    (
        ? = Very extreme effect, not inherently negative or positive
        + = Minor effect, always positive
        - = Stronger effects, but sometimes negative
    )
    ?Slime: May alter your equipment ability when capturing => Disabled by Intangible, buffed by Slime
    ?Armored: Attack is worth more than Speed when fighting => Disabled by Slime, buffed by Frost
    ?Intangible: Partially considers capture stat for fighting instead of Attack and Speed => Disabled by Lightning, buffed by Undead
    ?Flying: Speed is worth more than Attack when fighting => Disabled by Lightning, buffed by Arthropod
    ?Dark: May give a random stat change to a stat when capturing => Disabled by Holy, buffed by Demon

    +Undead: The encounter may stay active after fighting => Disabled by Holy, buffed by Dark
    +Water: May increase the duration of your active buff when capturing => Disabled by Frost, buffed by Slime
    +Beast: May buff Attack and Speed when fighting => Disabled by Fire, buffed by Reptile
    +Holy: May heal your HP in realms when capturing => Disabled by Demon, buffed by Legendary
    +Legendary: May buff any luck stat when capturing => Disabled by Demon, buffed by Dragon
    +Lightning: May charge your radar or buff your Speed when fighting => Disabled by Intangible, buffed by Water
    +Plant: May grant extra EXP when fighting => Disabled by Fire, buffed by Water

    -Dragon: May steal some of your Gold when fighting / May duplicate items dropped by monsters => Disabled by Dark, buffed by Legendary
    -Arthropod: May debuff your Drop Luck or Rare Luck when fighting / May grant you Scrap => Disabled by Reptile, buffed by Plant
    -Frost: May debuff your Speed when fighting / May buff your Drop Luck => Disabled by Fire, buffed by Intangible
    -Demon: May deal extra damage to you in realms when capturing / May increase the chance for you to receive Vortexes => Disabled by Dragon, buffed by Dark

    Keep in mind:
        - Encounters can disable or buff the effects of your favorited monster
        - Type effects that give you a buff will not trigger if you already have an active buff
        - When an effect is being buffed AND negated at the same time then it will retain its base values
        - A monster may disable or buff its OWN type effects if it has multiple types
        - A singular instance of a type can not disable or buff itself
        - Negative effects are more likely when you lose and less likely when you win. For positive effects it is the other way around
